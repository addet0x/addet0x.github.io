A strange realization: [Anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity) on a large part of the internet anno 2022 is payed in burner phones & work for Google (i.e. reCaptcha's). Two things that are imho fundamentally undesirable. 

The first ties identities to phone numbers which cost some time/dosh to manage and give govrnements and telco's the power to de-anonimize people. 

The second is late stage capitalism at it's worst: A(n [evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil#Google-Ditched-this-phrase-long-ago)) monopolist is gatekeeper for most if not nearly every important website. Yes, I'm looking at you Twitter. There are alternative platforms, but [as you'll quickly realize](https://www.twitterandteargas.org/) you need to have presence on the most popluar (monopolist) platforms. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
